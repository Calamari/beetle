=== Running the Examples

The top level Rakefile comes with targets to start several RabbitMQ and redis instances
locally. Make sure the corresponding binaries are in your search path. Open four new shell
windows and execute the following commands:

    rake rabbit:start1
    rake rabbit:start2
    rake redis:start1
    rake redis:start2

After running the redis_failover.rb example you will need to restart both redis servers.
