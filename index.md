title: Beetle - High Availability AMQP Messaging with Redundant Queues
---

### What is Beetle?
Beetle is a ruby gem built on top of the two widely used [bunny][bunny_gem] and
[amqp][amqp_gem] Ruby client libraries. It offers the following features:

* High Availability (by using N message broker instances)
* Redundancy (by replicating queues on all brokers)
* Simple client API (by encapsulating the message publishing / message deduplication
  logic)

### Architectural Overview

<div id="arch_img">

    <img src="/beetle/images/architecture.jpg" alt="Architecture" width="100%" height="100%"  border="0" />
  </a>
</div>

### Key System Properties

* N-2 message brokers can crash without causing any problems whatsoever
  (upgrading/maintenance becomes a snap)
* N-1 messages servers can crash without affecting the system (as long as the last server
  doesnâ€™t)
* If the deduplication store crashes, the workers will wait for it to come back online
* If a worker dies during message processing, the message will be reprocessed later
